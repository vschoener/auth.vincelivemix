# Vince live mix authentication service


This service handle user authentication across the services

For now, it's a poc to play around Golang, modules and try out architecture approach like NestJS or even Symfony.

TODO:
 - Check if dependency injection is the way to go with Golang or old fashion way should be used
 - Load config from env and have a way to inject them in the service
 - Move settings to env part
 - Create user database
 - Log in user using database
 - Refresh token should be added
 - Testing part must be done asap
 - ... ?
